# React + TypeScript + Sass + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules, along with:

- TypeScript
- Sass with automatic compilation
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- TypeScript support
- Sass compilation with automatic watching
- shadcn/ui components pre-configured
- Tailwind CSS with proper configuration
- Path aliases (@/ points to src/)

## Adding More shadcn/ui Components

You can add more shadcn/ui components as needed. Visit [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for more components and installation instructions.

## Sass Structure

The Sass files are structured as follows:
- `src/styles/variables.scss`: Global variables
- `src/styles/main.scss`: Main stylesheet with Tailwind imports

## Building for Production

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```
